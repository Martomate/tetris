# Tetris

This tetris game was the first game I ever made. It was made in 2012 (when I was in 9th grade) and was called "The Martomate". The original code can be found in the `original` folder, and it can be run like this:

```bash
cd original
task run
```

You need to install [Java](https://www.java.com) and [Task](https://taskfile.dev) to run it.

## Web version

I intend to remake this game in Rust so that it can run on the web. It will then be available on my website for anyone to play. Stay tuned :)
